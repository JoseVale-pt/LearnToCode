            <h1>About Yoda</h1>
            <em class="quote">Secret, shall I tell you? Grand Master of Jedi Order am I. Won this job in a
                raffle I did, think you?<span><br></span>How did you know, how did you know, Master Yoda?' Master Yoda knows these things. His job it
                    is.<span><br></span>―Yoda</em>
            <p>Yoda was one of the most renowned and powerful Jedi Masters in galactic history. He was known for his
                legendary wisdom, mastery of the Force and skills in lightsaber combat. Yoda served as a member of
                the Jedi High Council in the last centuries of the Galactic Republic and as Grand Master oversaw the
                Jedi Order before, during, and after the devastating Clone Wars. Following the First Battle of
                Geonosis, Yoda held the title of Master of the Order in addition to that of Grand Master. In his
                centuries of
                service to the galaxy and the Force, Grand Master Yoda had a hand in the training of nearly all the
                Jedi in
                the Order, including such luminaries as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ki-Adi-Mundi and Oppo Rancisis, all of whom
                would come to serve on the Jedi Council along with him.</p>
            <p>Standing about 66 cm tall, Yoda was a male member of a mysterious species, details of which he did
                not reveal. Yoda served as a member of the Jedi Order for centuries, eventually gaining a seat on
                the
                Jedi High Council, before reigning as the Grand Master of the Jedi. He had exceptional skills in
                lightsaber combat, having mastered all forms and stances of lightsaber combat, except the Vaapad
                subset of Form
                VII (he had mastered the original Form VII variant known as Juyo), but known for being particularly
                accomplished in Form IV, often employing the acrobatic techniques of the form. Many considered him a
                swordmaster and the greatest duelist in the Jedi Order, even surpassing Mace Windu and Count Dooku.
            </p>
            <p>Though arguably the Order's greatest master of the Force and most skilled warrior, Yoda believed most
                firmly in the importance of instructing younger generations and never missed an opportunity to
                ensure his students learn from their experiences. At heart, the diminutive Jedi Master was a
                teacher;
                indeed, he instructed nearly all the Jedi in the order, to some extent, during his reign as Grand
                Master.</p>
            <p>Though Yoda was, arguably, the most highly Force-attuned member of the Order, he was not flawless. It
                was partially due to his failure to recognize that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was actually
                responsible for the outbreak of the Clone Wars, and was in fact the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, which
                led to the
                Republic being overthrown and the Jedi Order being decimated. The Grand Master was among the few
                Jedi to survive Emperor Palpatine's Great Jedi Purge, after the beginning of which, he went into
                exile on
                the swamp planet of Dagobah.</p>
            <p>Later, before dying and becoming one with the Force in 4 ABY, the exiled Jedi Master was responsible
                for the instruction of Luke Skywalker who would use Yoda's training as a basis for the creation of a
                New
                Jedi Order, after defeating the Sith. Following his death, Master Yoda retained his identity within
                the Force and was revered as among the most legendary Jedi Masters of all time by Skywalker's
                reconstituted Order.</p><br>
